 Experiment No. 6 — Jenkins Master-Slave Architecture with Scaling
Aim:
To implement Jenkins Master–Slave architecture with scaling.
________________________________________
 Steps to Perform
________________________________________
STEP 1: Open Jenkins Dashboard
1.	Go to your browser → http://localhost:8080
2.	Log in to your Jenkins dashboard.
3.	Click on:
Manage Jenkins → Manage Nodes and Clouds → New Node
________________________________________
STEP 2: Create a New Node (Slave/Agent)
1.	In the Node Name field, enter a name like agent2.
2.	Select Permanent Agent → Click OK.
3.	This opens the configuration page for the new node.
________________________________________
STEP 3: Configure the Node
Fill in the following details:
•	Name: agent2
•	Description: Secondary build node
•	# of Executors: 1
•	Remote root directory: /home/jenkins (or any directory on the agent machine)
•	Labels: agent2 (this label will be used in jobs later)
•	Usage: "Use this node as much as possible"
•	Launch method: Select
👉 Launch agent by connecting it to the master (Java Web Start / JNLP)
Under Node Properties, if required, specify:
•	JDK path → /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
Then click Save.
________________________________________
STEP 4: Configure JNLP Port (Master Side)
After clicking Save, Jenkins will show an error message — because the master cannot yet communicate with the agent.
To fix it:
1.	Go to Manage Jenkins → Security → Configure Global Security.
2.	Find TCP port for inbound agents.
3.	Set a fixed port, e.g. 50000.
4.	Click Save.
Now, from the terminal (on master system), allow this port through the firewall:
sudo ufw allow 50000/tcp
✅ This allows Jenkins Master to accept agent connections.
________________________________________
STEP 5: Connect the Slave (Agent) Machine
Now go back to Jenkins:
1.	Go to Manage Jenkins → Nodes → agent2
2.	You’ll see “Launch agent via Java Web Start” instructions.
3.	Copy the command shown there — something like:
4.	java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://<master-ip>:8080/computer/agent2/slave-agent.jnlp -secret <secret-key> -workDir "/home/jenkins"
5.	Run this command on your agent machine (or same machine if simulating).
✅ Once executed, you’ll see a message:
INFO: Connected to Jenkins master
and in Jenkins → agent2 will show Connected (green dot).
________________________________________
STEP 6: Create a Job to Test the Agent
1.	Go to Dashboard → New Item → Freestyle Project.
2.	Enter a name like test-agent-job.
3.	In Restrict where this project can be run, type:
4.	agent2
5.	Add a Build Step → Execute Shell, and enter:
6.	echo "Hello from Agent Node!"
7.	hostname
8.	Click Save and then Build Now.
________________________________________
STEP 7: Check the Output
1.	Click on the build number → Console Output
2.	You’ll see:
3.	Hello from Agent Node!
4.	<agent-system-name>
✅ This confirms your Jenkins Slave node successfully executed the job.
________________________________________
STEP 8: Verify Connected Nodes
1.	Go to Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Nodes
2.	You’ll see both:
o	Master (built-in node)
o	agent2 (connected)
✅ You can now add more slave nodes with different environments for scaling.
