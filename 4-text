Experiment No. 4: To install Jenkins and configure parallel jobs for building pipeline 
Steps: 
1) Create 3 Jobs: Testing, Staging and Production 
2) Add build step for each and choose “Execute Shell” option 
a. For Testing: 
sleep 10 
echo “This is testing phase” 
b. For Staging: 
sleep 10 
echo “This is staging phase” 
c. For Production: 
sleep 10 
echo “This is production phase” 
3) Go to “Testing” > Configure > Add post build action > build other project and select 
“Staging”. Do the same for “Staging” but here use “build other project (manual step)” 
and select “Production” 
4) Go to Dashboard and create a new “Build Pipeline View”. Select “Testing” as the 
“Select Initial Job” 
5) Run and keep refreshing till the pipeline is executed. Manually run the Production 
project. 
6) In the Staging project, change the post build action from “build other project (manual 
step)” to “build other project”. 
7) Select “Production” in projects to build and re run the pipeline. (This is time manual 
intervention is not needed for production) 
8) For Parallel Jobs, create a new job and add it to the post build action of Testing. 
9) Run the pipeline again and keep reloading.
